# Lazy Object Initialization C#

## Overview

This project demonstrates **lazy initialization** in C# using the `Lazy<T>` class. Lazy initialization is a design pattern that defers 
the creation of an object until it is actually needed, which can improve performance and reduce resource usage—especially when dealing 
with expensive or resource-heavy objects.

The project is structured to show how an `ExpensiveObject` is only created when accessed, rather than at program startup.

## Project Structure

```
lazy-object-initialization-cs/
├── Program.cs       // Entry point of the application
└── Solution.cs      // Contains the ExpensiveObject class and lazy initialization logic
```

## Features

- Uses `Lazy<T>` to delay object creation.
- Demonstrates that the object is only created once, even if accessed multiple times.
- Includes detailed console output to trace the lifecycle of the object.
- Clean separation of concerns between execution logic and object management.

## How It Works

1. The `ExpensiveObject` class simulates a resource-heavy object by printing a message when constructed.
2. The `Solution` class wraps the object in a `Lazy<ExpensiveObject>` instance.
3. The `Program` class accesses the object via `Solution.GetExpensiveObject()`, triggering its creation only when needed.
4. Subsequent accesses reuse the same instance without re-creating it.

## Requirements

- .NET Framework or .NET Core supporting C# 7.0
- Compatible IDE (e.g., Visual Studio, VS Code)

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred C# IDE.
3. Build and run the solution.
4. Observe the console output to see when the object is created and used.
